🔑 Authentication (Users Only)

🏢 Tenant Management
Tenants are separate from users. Only an authenticated user can create a tenant.

GET	/tenants/{tenantId}	Get tenant details
PUT	/tenants/{tenantId}	Update tenant info
DELETE	/tenants/{tenantId}	Delete tenant (only by admin)
🔗 Tenant Membership & Invites
Since a user is separate from a tenant, they need a way to join a tenant.

GET	/tenants/{tenantId}/members	Get all members of a tenant
POST	/tenants/{tenantId}/join	Request to join a tenant (with invite or ID)

📌 Task Management (Inside a Tenant)
Tasks are always tenant-based. A user must be a member of a tenant to manage tasks.

POST	/tenants/{tenantId}/tasks	Create a new task
GET	/tenants/{tenantId}/tasks	Get all tasks in a tenant
GET	/tenants/{tenantId}/tasks/{taskId}	Get details of a specific task

DELETE	/tenants/{tenantId}/tasks/{taskId}	Delete a task
📌 Task Assignment
Each task can be assigned to a specific user in the tenant.

POST	/tenants/{tenantId}/tasks/{taskId}/assign	Assign task to a user
DELETE	/tenants/{tenantId}/tasks/{taskId}/unassign/{userId}	Unassign a user from a task
📢 WebSocket Events (Real-Time Updates)
Since we're using Socket.IO for real-time task updates, we'll also document our WebSocket events.

Event Name	Description
task:created	Broadcast when a task is created
task:updated	Broadcast when a task is updated
task:deleted	Broadcast when a task is deleted
task:assigned	Notify users when a task is assigned to them
🗂️ Does Folder Structure Change Because of WebSocket?
Yes, our project structure will look different because of Socket.IO integration. Here’s an example:

bash

💡 Summary
Two separate API paths for user and tenant actions.

Multi-Tenant model: Users create accounts separately & join tenants via invitation.

Task management is tenant-based.

WebSocket for real-time task updates.

Folder structure includes a dedicated sockets/ directory.
